# 11ty & Tailwind ⚡

Hello, this is just a basic webpage I created using 11ty and Tailwind CSS so I don't get bored with updating my personal website lol. It's still not finished that's why I haven't deployed it yet.. I will add more features with this soon 👀

You can email me with my email address on my GitHub Profile or [create an Issue](https://github.com/lancerossdev/eleventy-tailwind/issues/new) if you think there's something wrong or you want to suggest a feature. I will appreciate your help!

## Dev Notes 📝

You can use `npm i` or `pnpm i` to install dependencies. I personally use `yarn` because it's what I use on most of my projects.

`yarn` - Installs dependencies. You can use any of those.

`yarn run dev` - Starts local dev server at `localhost:8080`

`yarn run build` - Build your production site to `./dist/`
